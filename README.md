# hello-world
This is a place for everything and anything, ideas, junk, garbage, lost pens etc. 
I've been learning a little bit of Java and Python the last few years but really struggled to sit down and get into it. It's not that I dont understand it, It's that I dont set aside the time to learn.... having a full time job already makes it dificult.
